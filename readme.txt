== Description ==

This plugin will disable all non-admin users (with capabilities), from creating and adding new pages in your blog.

Works very well with the 'WP Restrict User 'ADD NEW POST' plugins (that prevents non-admin users from creating and adding new POSTS), to your blog. 

The "add new page" submenu will also be hidden from the non-admin user.
