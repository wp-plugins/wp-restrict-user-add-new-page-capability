== Description ==

This plugin will disable all non-admin users (with capabilities), from creating and adding new pages in your blog.
Works very well with the 'WP Restrict User 'ADD NEW POST' Capability' plugin (to prevent non-admins from creating and adding new POSTS), to your blog. 
The "add new page" submenu will also be hidden from the non-admin user.


== User Posting Capabilities with this plugin ==

This plugin specifically prevents and disables the 'EDITOR' as well as the 'AUTHOR' level users from creating and adding new PAGES from the user dashboard (and within your blog). All 
other capabilities of the specified user levels, however, will remain the same.


== Installation ==

2. Upload and extract the contents of nopage.zip to your wp-content/plugins/folder
3. Activate the WP Restrict User 'ADD NEW PAGE' Capability in your WP-admin
4. Done!
